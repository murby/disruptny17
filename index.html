Panda’s - pretty cute right? Look at them, just rolling around loving life.

However, have you ever looked at one of these ridiculous, fun loving, playful bears and wondered what they are really up to?

Because, behind their cuddly exterior these bears are geo-political operatives waging a global campaign on behalf of the People’s Republic of China.

Panda diplomacy goes back to the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, when a pair of giant pandas was gifted to the Japanese emperor. This fell out of practice but the People’s Republic of China brought it back in the 1950, and notably gifted two pandas to the United States after President Nixon visited in the 70’s.

The Pandas were a big hit at the national zoo in DC, with over one million people coming to see them in the first year. And thus began the 2nd era of Panda diplomacy as more and more countries asked for or were offered Pandas from China.

So just be nice to China for a bit and you get to keep a Panda?

Nope. Pandas come with contracts. Namely a 10 year lease and might cost up to a million dollars a year. Also, if your pandas make baby pandas - those little guys belong to China. All this in addition to the cost of setting up Panda facilities that can run into many millions.

But, outside of dollars and babies what does China get out of this?

Traditionally the program was designed as an exercise in soft power - keeping ties strong and rewarding partners for signing agreements.

However, following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake - which badly damaged the Wolong Nature Reserve where breeding takes place - there was also need to house the pandas and generate funds for the center’s repairs. This contributed to a big increase in activity with loans being extended and Pandas going to Japan, Scotland, Canada, France and Singapore. Notably,  all of these deals also coincided with significant trade and diplomatic deals.

In life and diplomacy not everything always goes to plan. When in 2005 China tried to give two pandas to Taiwan the bears were caught up in political kerfuffel as the pro independence ruling party in Taiwan didn’t want to accept the Pandas fearing it would show unity with Bejing.

Now go grow some bamboo - it’s all they eat!

By the way - my favorite one is the red dude.
